some small coding with JS or JQuery. current I have the following need help with:
1.	Currently the sign up error msg overlap texts in sign up modal
2.	If you don’t have a product listed under your account, selling history should display something like: “You have not listed anything yet, list it <a href=”…”>now</a>
3.	Sell a product == add timestamp when add to the DB
4.	Add logic to add a product page where start bidding price must be smaller than buy it now price


If you are very comfortable with coding, you can help me do the following:

2.	when add new product, create category db that save all currently bidding products into that specific category
3.	index.html display all added product
4.	the rest of to do pages
5.	in delete a product function, need to delete img from the storage too
6.	remove all product in the index.html, set up <Div> structure for the area to display product by category
7.	strip off bootstrip from the index.html page. we only use materilize for the project
